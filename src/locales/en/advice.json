  "sleepPositionNeck": "Be careful with your stomach sleeping position",
  "sleepPositionNeckDescription": "If you have neck pain, we do not recommend sleeping on your stomach. This sleeping position causes the cervical spine to rotate, which can contribute to pain and stiffness in this area. Sleeping on your side or back is ideal for your neck. If you sleep on your side, you can use a pregnancy pillow to help prevent twisting.",

  "lumbarPad": "Lumbar pillow",
  "lumbarPadBreaks": "Do not use the pillow all day, but rather as a temporary aid. Remember that there is no such thing as a good sitting position, and therefore even prolonged sitting upright can contribute to your symptoms.",
  "lumbarPadDescription": "Regularly changing the type of sitting can positively affect your back, preventing or reducing pain. The lumbar pillow serves to support an upright sitting position without the need to actively hold yourself in an upright position, which could lead to overloading the back erectors. In this way, you can give your spine and muscles a different position than a slouched sitting position for a while."
