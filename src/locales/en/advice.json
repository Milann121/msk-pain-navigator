  "sleepPositionNeck": "Be careful with your stomach sleeping position",
  "sleepPositionNeckDescription": "If you have neck pain, we do not recommend sleeping on your stomach. This sleeping position causes the cervical spine to rotate, which can contribute to pain and stiffness in this area. Sleeping on your side or back is ideal for your neck. If you sleep on your side, you can use a pregnancy pillow to help prevent twisting.",

  "lumbarPad": "Lumbar pillow",
  "lumbarPadBreaks": "Do not use the pillow all day, but rather as a temporary aid. Remember that there is no such thing as a good sitting position, and therefore even prolonged sitting upright can contribute to your symptoms.",
  "lumbarPadDescription": "Regularly changing the type of sitting can positively affect your back, preventing or reducing pain. The lumbar pillow serves to support an upright sitting position without the need to actively hold yourself in an upright position, which could lead to overloading the back erectors. In this way, you can give your spine and muscles a different position than a slouched sitting position for a while.",

  "objectLifting": "Be careful of your center of gravity when lifting objects",
  "objectLiftingRule": "Avoid lifting objects that are further away from you (or in front of you).",
  "objectLiftingDescription": "When lifting objects (no matter how light or heavy) make sure that your center of gravity is as close to your body as possible, i.e. try to keep the objects you are lifting under you when you lift them. Avoid lifting, pulling or pushing objects that are significantly in front of you (or away from you).",

  "supermanSleep": "Don't sleep with your arm stretched out under your head",
  "supermanSleepRule": "Avoid sleeping with your arm stretched out above your head (in the 'superman' position), or with your arm placed behind your head.",
  "supermanSleepDescription": "When sleeping on your side with your arm placed under the pillow, make sure that your elbow is at the level of your chin at most. In this position, I also recommend that you bend your arm at the elbow joint. If you sleep on your back and your arm is placed behind your head, try to fall asleep in the side position to eliminate this bad habit."
